Cross-Border (Global)

These terms and conditions are in addition to the standard Terms of Sale and Terms of Use on our website and mobile applications. Title and risk of loss for the items transfers to the recipient upon delivery to the carrier in the exporting country.

Each item in your order is sold by CartJO or the seller that the item is specified as sold by ("Seller").

Import Charges

Those items for shipment to countries outside of Jordan may be subject to taxes, customs duties, government charges, and any other costs levied by the destination country ("Import Fee"). When purchasing International Products, you acknowledge that the sale occurs outside of the destination country and that you are importing the products for your personal use, which will be reflected on customs documentation. The recipient of the shipment is the importer of record in the destination country and is responsible for all Import Charges.

With respect to each item for which Import Charges have been calculated, you authorize CartJO or Seller (as applicable) to designate a carrier or agent ("Designated Carrier") to act as your direct or indirect representative/agent with the relevant customs and tax authorities in the destination country, to clear your merchandise, process and remit your actual Import Charges for such item, and provide any other information pertaining to you or your order to any governmental authority in the destination country or abroad, as may be requested.

"Import Charges Deposit" represents an estimate of the Import Charges that will be levied on the items in your order for shipment to countries outside of Jordan. By placing your order, you agree to allow CartJO and/or Seller (as applicable) to collect the Import Charges Deposit for the applicable items in your order. This fee will be used, on your behalf, to reimburse the Designated Carriers for the Import Charges that they have paid on your behalf to the appropriate authorities of the destination country.

You further agree that the Designated Carriers may disclose to CartJO or Seller (as applicable) the amount of actual Import Charges along with any other charges incurred by CartJO or Seller to make the order available to you outside Jordan, levied on the item you have purchased from CartJO and/or Seller.

In the case of gifts or purchases made on behalf of another recipient, you also agree to grant the foregoing authorizations on behalf of the recipient designated in your order.

Imports are subject to opening and inspection by customs and/or postal authorities. We may provide certain order, shipment, and product information, such as product names or titles, to the Designated Carriers, and such information may be communicated by the Designated Carriers to customs and/or postal authorities in order to facilitate customs clearance and comply with local laws. Customs authorities require the value of the gift item to be stated directly on the package. Therefore, even if the order is a gift, the package will be marked "Gift," but the cost of the item will be stated on the customs form.

To obtain details regarding the Import Charges, or to obtain documentation or receipts in connection with customs clearance, you may contact the Designated Carrier specified in your shipment confirmation.

We will require you to provide us with your ID number and full name to ensure smooth customs clearance and prompt delivery of your order. Acceptable documents include your National ID name and number, or your name and number on any government-issued document providing proof of residence. Please note that the name on the ID card must match the name used for the order.

Returns and Refund

In case of return of the items, in addition to the existing return conditions applicable to such items that are available on our website and mobile applications, you acknowledge that you will not receive any refund for the Import Charges.

When you request to return an item, the Seller may (at its sole discretion) elect to issue a refund without requiring a return, or require that you return the product to an address located either inside Jordan or, if different, your delivery country ("Local Return Destination").

If you are required to return the item to a Local Return Destination, CartJO will decide (in its sole discretion) whether to forward the item to an address that is outside both Jordan and your delivery country ("International Return Destination"), or otherwise how to handle it. By initiating the returns process, you expressly authorize CartJO to handle the returned product on your behalf. If the returned product is ultimately forwarded to the International Return Destination, you will be responsible for clearing the goods (as exporter of record), and you authorize us to do so on your behalf by allowing CartJO to designate a carrier who will act as your direct or indirect representative/agent with the relevant customs and tax authorities in the country of exportation.

General (Cross-Border)

Please note that Sellers may have policies that differ from CartJO’s terms and conditions. For items you have purchased from a Seller, please see the applicable Seller’s policies for any other terms and conditions that may apply to your purchase of such items, including the warranty of such items.

International items are marketed, distributed, and sold in the applicable source country listed but made available to you through CartJO. Consequently, some international items may not be designed to the same specifications as products of the destination country and may differ from versions sold in the destination country, including in their fit, default settings, age ratings, and language. Foreign versions of certain items, such as software and phones, may be region-locked against use in the destination country. Manufacturer warranties may not apply in the destination country and manufacturer service options may not be available. You are responsible for reviewing available product information to ensure that the international item you are purchasing meets your needs and expectations.

To the extent permitted by law, these terms are governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of Jordan. Any dispute shall be finally settled by arbitration under the Arbitration Rules of the Amman Chamber of Commerce (or a similar, relevant body), which Rules are deemed to be incorporated by reference into this clause. The number of arbitrators shall be one. The seat, or legal place, of arbitration shall be Amman, Jordan. The language to be used in the arbitration shall be English.

We reserve the right to make changes to these terms and conditions at any time by posting the changes on our website. You will be subject to the terms, conditions, and policies in force at the time that you purchase the items.

The Arabic version of these terms and conditions was translated from English. The English language version is the definitive version. In case of inconsistency or ambiguity between the Arabic text and the English text, the English text will prevail." use md rules
