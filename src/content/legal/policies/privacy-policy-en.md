We collect, use, store, and transfer many types of Personal Data about you, which are categorized as follows:

* **Identity Data** includes details such as: your first name, middle name, last name, your username or similar identifiers, gender, title, nationality, and date of birth.
* **Contact Data** includes your address, email address, and telephone number.
* **Transaction Data** includes information about payments to and from you, including, without limitation, your payment methods, as well as details of the products and services you have purchased from us.

* **Profile Data** includes your username and password, your interests, preferences, feedback, preferred language, and survey responses.

In addition, we collect, use, and share statistical or demographic information ("**Aggregated Data**"). Aggregated Data is extracted from your Personal Data but has been modified to remove identifiers and does not directly or indirectly reveal your identity. For example, we may aggregate Personal Data from the browser to determine the percentage of users accessing a specific feature on the website.

## 7. How Do We Store Your Personal Data and For How Long?

The Personal Data we collect from you may be transferred to, stored, and processed by employees working for us or for one of our service providers. These employees may be engaged in, among other things, the fulfillment of your order, the processing of your payment details, and the provision of support services. We will store your information **for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes specified in this Privacy Policy or as permitted or required by law**. To determine the appropriate retention period, we consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the Personal Data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure, the purposes for which we process it and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal, regulatory, tax, accounting, or other requirements. In some circumstances, we may **anonymize** your Personal Data (so that it can no longer be associated with you) for research or statistical purposes, in which case we may use this information indefinitely without further notice to you.

## 8. What Security Measures Do We Implement?

We have designed our systems with your security and privacy in mind. We maintain **commercially reasonable technical, administrative, and physical safeguards** to ensure your Personal Data is treated securely and in accordance with this Privacy Policy and applicable laws, preventing unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, or destruction. For example, we may use **encryption technology** to secure your Personal Data during transmission, in addition to **external firewall** and **host firewall technology** to prevent any network-level attacks. Access to this Personal Data is only permitted to authorized employees, contractors, and agents who need to know your Personal Data in connection with the performance of their services. We also follow the **Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard** when handling credit card data.

It is important for you to protect yourself against unauthorized access to your password and to the devices used to access our services. You are also responsible for maintaining the **confidentiality of your password**. (For example: make sure you log out when you finish using a shared device).
