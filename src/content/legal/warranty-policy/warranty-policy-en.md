* **Address:** The address provided during the warranty claim will be used for both pickup and delivery. Contact Cartjo Customer Care for address changes; this is subject to courier partner availability.

* **Inspection Fee:** Service centers may charge an inspection fee if the warranty claim is **rejected** (e.g., no defect found) or the item is **out of warranty**.
* **Exclusions:** Warranty **does not cover** damage from **accidents, abuse, misuse, liquid contact, or other external causes**. These are considered out of warranty.
* **Post-Service Reporting:** Any issues (e.g., damaged item, missing accessories, non-receipt after delivery notification) must be reported within **48 hours** of the delivery time. Later claims will not be accepted.
* **Data Responsibility:** You are responsible for **backing up your personal data**, turning off **"Find My Device,"** and removing all **locks/passwords** before handing over the device.
